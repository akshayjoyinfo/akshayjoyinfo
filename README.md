## 🏗️ Building Resilient, Scalable Systems  

I design, build, and optimize **cloud-native, event-driven, high-scale systems**. Whether it's **distributed computing, low-latency architecture, or DevOps automation**, I deliver solutions that **just work**—efficiently, securely, and at scale.  

### 🔹 **Key Strengths**  
✅ **Cloud & Infrastructure** – AWS, Azure, Multi-cloud architectures  
✅ **Microservices & APIs** – Scalable, resilient services with domain-driven design  
✅ **Event-Driven Systems** – Kafka, Service Bus, RabbitMQ, real-time data processing  
✅ **DevOps & Automation** – CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Infrastructure as Code  
✅ **Performance & Scalability** – Optimizing databases, APIs, and distributed workloads

## 🚀 How I Work  

🔹 **Engineering for Scale** – I don’t just write code; I architect systems that scale globally.  
🔹 **Efficiency Obsessed** – Every millisecond and every query matters. Performance is king.  
🔹 **DevOps & Automation First** – CI/CD, Infra as Code, monitoring—fully automated workflows.  
🔹 **No-Fluff Execution** – Clear requirements, fast iterations, and high-quality delivery.
